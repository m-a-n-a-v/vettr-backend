## VS2-001: Create financial_data schema table
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Created src/db/schema/financial-data.ts with 15 financial fields (cash, monthly_burn, total_debt, total_assets, exploration_exp, r_and_d_exp, total_opex, g_and_a_expense, revenue, shares_current, shares_1yr_ago, insider_shares, total_shares, avg_vol_30d, days_since_last_pr)
- Used uuid PK, stock_id FK with cascade delete and unique constraint
- All numeric fields are nullable to support partial data scenarios
- Added index on stock_id for efficient lookups
- Exported financialData from schema/index.ts barrel
- Build passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - bigint fields need { mode: 'number' } option to avoid BigInt type issues in TypeScript
  - Schema files follow consistent pattern: import from drizzle-orm/pg-core, import related tables, define table with indexes in callback
  - Always add .js extension to local imports (ESM requirement)

## VS2-002: Create financial data seed file
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Created src/db/seed/financial-data.ts with seedFinancialData function
- Seeded all 25 stocks with realistic financial data based on sector and market cap
- Mining sector stocks (NXE, ARIS, LUN, FM, TKO, ERO, CS, MAG, FVI, AEM, ELD, BTO, NGD, IMG, MND, LUG, KRR, RIO, SBB, GPL, FR, AG) have exploration_exp populated
- Tech/financial services stocks (SII) have r_and_d_exp populated  
- Royalty/streaming companies (WPM, OR) have both exploration_exp and r_and_d_exp as null
- 3 stocks (FM, ELD, IMG) have null cash AND null monthly_burn for testing null P1 Financial Survival pillar handling
- All stocks have complete data for: revenue, total_opex, g_and_a_expense, total_debt, total_assets, shares_current, shares_1yr_ago, insider_shares, total_shares, avg_vol_30d, days_since_last_pr
- Profitable companies have negative monthly_burn values (LUN, ERO, CS, FVI, WPM, AEM, OR, SII, BTO, LUG, KRR, FR, AG)
- Pre-production/development stage companies have zero revenue (NXE, MAG, RIO, SBB)
- Registered seedFinancialData in src/db/seed/index.ts (called after executives seed)
- Uses upsert on stock_id for safe re-seeding
- Build passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Financial data must be sector-realistic: mining companies need exploration_exp, tech companies need r_and_d_exp
  - Negative monthly_burn indicates profitability (cash generation)
  - Null cash/burn scenarios are important for testing null pillar weight redistribution
  - Used onConflictDoUpdate with stock_id unique constraint for safe re-seeding
  - Share dilution scenarios included (some stocks have significantly more shares_current vs shares_1yr_ago)
  - Insider ownership varies from 5% to 20% across stocks for realistic Shareholder Structure scoring

## VS2-003: Alter vetr_score_history schema for 4 pillars
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Replaced 5 old pillar columns (pedigreeScore, filingVelocityScore, redFlagScore, growthScore, governanceScore) with 4 new pillar columns
- Removed bonusPoints and penaltyPoints columns
- Added 4 pillar score columns (integer, not null, default 0): financialSurvivalScore, operationalEfficiencyScore, shareholderStructureScore, marketSentimentScore
- Added 8 sub-score columns (integer, nullable): cashRunwayScore, solvencyScore, efficiencyScore, pedigreeSubScore, dilutionPenaltyScore, insiderAlignmentScore, liquidityScore, newsVelocityScore
- Added 4 weight columns (doublePrecision, nullable): p1Weight, p2Weight, p3Weight, p4Weight
- Updated ScoreHistoryEntry interface to match new schema structure
- Added TODO comments and temporary placeholder values in saveScoreToHistory and getScoreHistory functions (will be replaced in VS2-009 and VS2-011)
- Kept existing columns: id, stockTicker, overallScore, calculatedAt
- Kept existing indexes on stockTicker and calculatedAt
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When altering a schema table, all TypeScript interfaces and service functions that reference the old schema must be updated to prevent build errors
  - Added doublePrecision import to pg-core imports for weight columns
  - Temporary placeholder values allow the codebase to remain in a working state while the full 4-pillar calculation logic is implemented in later stories
  - TODO comments clearly mark areas that will be updated in future stories (VS2-009, VS2-011)
  - Schema migrations like this should be carefully coordinated with service layer updates to avoid breaking changes

## VS2-004: Implement P1 Financial Survival calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented financialSurvivalScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, cashRunway, solvency } or null if all inputs are null
- Cash Runway sub-metric (60% weight): handles profitable companies (monthly_burn <= 0 → score 100), zero cash (cash === 0 → score 0), and normal calculation (months = cash / monthly_burn, normalized to 18 months = 100)
- Solvency sub-metric (40% weight): handles zero assets (→ score 0), zero debt (→ score 100), and normal calculation (ratio = total_debt / total_assets, score = max(0, 100 - ratio * 200))
- Final score combines both sub-metrics with weights (60% cash runway, 40% solvency)
- Handles partial data scenarios: if only one sub-metric is available, uses that metric alone
- Returns null if ALL inputs are null, enabling null pillar weight redistribution in later stories
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Financial Survival pillar is crucial for early-stage companies with limited cash runway
  - Profitable companies (negative monthly_burn) get full 100 score for cash runway to reward cash generation
  - Null pillar handling allows flexible scoring when financial data is incomplete
  - Used Math.min() and Math.max() to clamp scores to 0-100 range
  - Separated sub-metric calculation logic for clarity and maintainability

## VS2-005: Implement P2 Operational Efficiency calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented operationalEfficiencyScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, efficiencyRatio } or null if all inputs are null
- Sector-specific formulas:
  - Mining sector (contains 'Mining', 'Gold', 'Resource'): ratio = exploration_exp / total_opex
  - Tech sector (contains 'Tech', 'Software'): ratio = r_and_d_exp / total_opex
  - General/all other sectors: ratio = (revenue - g_and_a_expense) / revenue
- Edge case handling:
  - If total_opex === 0 → score 50 (neutral score for no operating expenses)
  - If revenue === 0 for general sector → score 0 (no revenue, no efficiency)
  - If ratio > 1 → score 100 (capped at maximum)
- Normalization: score = min(100, ratio / 0.70 * 100) where target ratio 0.70 = 100 score
- Returns null if all required inputs for the sector are null, enabling null pillar weight redistribution
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sector-specific logic requires case-insensitive string matching on sector names
  - Different sectors optimize for different metrics (mining=exploration, tech=R&D, general=gross margin)
  - Edge cases like zero opex or zero revenue need specific handling to avoid division by zero
  - Null pillar handling allows flexible scoring when sector-specific data is incomplete
  - The 0.70 normalization target represents a 70% efficiency ratio as "excellent" (100 score)
  - Separated edge case checks before main ratio calculation for code clarity

## VS2-006: Implement P3 Shareholder Structure calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented shareholderStructureScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, pedigree, dilution, insider } or null if all inputs are null
- Pedigree sub-metric (50% weight):
  - E (Experience): Average years (yearsAtCompany + previousCompanies * 3) * 5, max 100
  - C (Career Diversity): Count unique previous companies across all executives * 10, max 100
  - A (Academic): Education field mapping using keyword matching (PhD=100, MBA=90, Master=85, etc.)
  - M (Market Alignment): Default 50 (no market alignment data available)
  - PG = E×0.40 + C×0.25 + A×0.20 + M×0.15
  - If no executives → default score 50
- Dilution Penalty sub-metric (30% weight):
  - dilution_pct = (shares_current - shares_1yr_ago) / shares_1yr_ago
  - If shares_1yr_ago null → score 100 (benefit of the doubt)
  - If dilution < 0 (buyback) → score 100
  - score = max(0, 100 - dilution_pct * 200) where 50% dilution = 0 score
- Insider Alignment sub-metric (20% weight):
  - ownership_pct = insider_shares / total_shares
  - score = min(100, ownership_pct / 0.20 * 100) where 20% ownership = 100 score
  - If data null → default score 50
- Final score combines all sub-metrics: P3 = pedigree * 0.50 + dilution * 0.30 + insider * 0.20
- Handles null pillar scenario: returns null if all inputs are null (no executives and no share data)
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pedigree calculation uses the same executive data structure as the old pedigreeScore function but with a new formula
  - Career diversity now counts unique previous companies across ALL executives (not per executive)
  - Education mapping uses keyword matching for common designations (P.Eng, P.Geo, CPA, CFA, MBA, PhD, etc.)
  - Share dilution is a critical metric for early-stage companies with frequent financings
  - Buyback scenarios (negative dilution) get full score to reward shareholder-friendly capital allocation
  - Insider ownership target of 20% = 100 score aligns with good corporate governance practices
  - The default scores (50 for missing data) provide a neutral baseline when data is unavailable
  - Sub-metric weights (50% pedigree, 30% dilution, 20% insider) reflect relative importance of each factor

## VS2-007: Implement P4 Market Sentiment calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented marketSentimentScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, liquidity, newsVelocity } or null if all inputs are null
- Liquidity Health sub-metric (60% weight): dailyVolValue = avg_vol_30d * price; score = min(100, dailyVolValue / 100000 * 100) where target $100k = 100 score
- News Velocity sub-metric (40% weight): uses days_since_last_pr if available, otherwise computes from filingList (days since most recent filing), defaults to 90 days if both null
- News Velocity scoring: days < 14 → score 100; days > 60 → score 0; linear decay in between: score = max(0, 100 - ((days - 14) * 100) / 46)
- Final score combines both sub-metrics with weights (60% liquidity, 40% news velocity)
- Handles partial data scenarios: if only one sub-metric is available, uses that metric alone
- Returns null if ALL inputs are null, enabling null pillar weight redistribution in later stories
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Market Sentiment pillar captures both liquidity (trading activity) and market engagement (news/filings)
  - Liquidity score uses dollar volume (shares × price) rather than just share volume to reflect actual capital flow
  - News Velocity uses a 14-60 day window: 14 days = fresh/engaged, 60+ days = stale/inactive
  - Linear decay formula for News Velocity: (100 - ((days - 14) * 100) / 46) creates smooth transition from 100 to 0
  - Fallback from days_since_last_pr to filingList provides robustness when PR-specific data isn't available
  - Default 90 days for news velocity when both inputs are null ensures a low (0) score for companies with no data
  - The P4 pillar has the lowest weight (15%) reflecting that market sentiment is less fundamental than financial/operational metrics

## VS2-008: Implement null pillar weight redistribution
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented redistributeWeights() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { adjustedWeights: Record<string, number>, nullPillars: string[] }
- Handles three scenarios:
  1. All pillars present: weights unchanged (0.35, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15)
  2. One or more pillars null: their weight distributed proportionally to remaining pillars (baseWeight / totalAvailable)
  3. All pillars null: overall score = 0, all weights = 0
- Example: if P2 (0.25) is null, totalAvailable = 0.75:
  - newP1 = 0.35 / 0.75 = 0.4667
  - newP3 = 0.25 / 0.75 = 0.3333
  - newP4 = 0.15 / 0.75 = 0.2000
- nullPillars array lists the string names of skipped pillars
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Weight redistribution ensures that the overall score calculation remains valid when some pillars have incomplete data
  - The function takes a generic array of pillar results with pillar name, score (or null), and base weight
  - Proportional redistribution maintains the relative importance of remaining pillars
  - Setting all weights to 0 when all pillars are null prevents division by zero in the overall score calculation
  - This function will be used in VS2-009 to rewrite calculateVetrScore with the 4-pillar formula
  - Clear documentation in the function comment helps explain the redistribution logic with concrete examples
