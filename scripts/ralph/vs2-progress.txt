## VS2-001: Create financial_data schema table
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Created src/db/schema/financial-data.ts with 15 financial fields (cash, monthly_burn, total_debt, total_assets, exploration_exp, r_and_d_exp, total_opex, g_and_a_expense, revenue, shares_current, shares_1yr_ago, insider_shares, total_shares, avg_vol_30d, days_since_last_pr)
- Used uuid PK, stock_id FK with cascade delete and unique constraint
- All numeric fields are nullable to support partial data scenarios
- Added index on stock_id for efficient lookups
- Exported financialData from schema/index.ts barrel
- Build passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - bigint fields need { mode: 'number' } option to avoid BigInt type issues in TypeScript
  - Schema files follow consistent pattern: import from drizzle-orm/pg-core, import related tables, define table with indexes in callback
  - Always add .js extension to local imports (ESM requirement)

## VS2-002: Create financial data seed file
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Created src/db/seed/financial-data.ts with seedFinancialData function
- Seeded all 25 stocks with realistic financial data based on sector and market cap
- Mining sector stocks (NXE, ARIS, LUN, FM, TKO, ERO, CS, MAG, FVI, AEM, ELD, BTO, NGD, IMG, MND, LUG, KRR, RIO, SBB, GPL, FR, AG) have exploration_exp populated
- Tech/financial services stocks (SII) have r_and_d_exp populated  
- Royalty/streaming companies (WPM, OR) have both exploration_exp and r_and_d_exp as null
- 3 stocks (FM, ELD, IMG) have null cash AND null monthly_burn for testing null P1 Financial Survival pillar handling
- All stocks have complete data for: revenue, total_opex, g_and_a_expense, total_debt, total_assets, shares_current, shares_1yr_ago, insider_shares, total_shares, avg_vol_30d, days_since_last_pr
- Profitable companies have negative monthly_burn values (LUN, ERO, CS, FVI, WPM, AEM, OR, SII, BTO, LUG, KRR, FR, AG)
- Pre-production/development stage companies have zero revenue (NXE, MAG, RIO, SBB)
- Registered seedFinancialData in src/db/seed/index.ts (called after executives seed)
- Uses upsert on stock_id for safe re-seeding
- Build passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Financial data must be sector-realistic: mining companies need exploration_exp, tech companies need r_and_d_exp
  - Negative monthly_burn indicates profitability (cash generation)
  - Null cash/burn scenarios are important for testing null pillar weight redistribution
  - Used onConflictDoUpdate with stock_id unique constraint for safe re-seeding
  - Share dilution scenarios included (some stocks have significantly more shares_current vs shares_1yr_ago)
  - Insider ownership varies from 5% to 20% across stocks for realistic Shareholder Structure scoring

## VS2-003: Alter vetr_score_history schema for 4 pillars
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Replaced 5 old pillar columns (pedigreeScore, filingVelocityScore, redFlagScore, growthScore, governanceScore) with 4 new pillar columns
- Removed bonusPoints and penaltyPoints columns
- Added 4 pillar score columns (integer, not null, default 0): financialSurvivalScore, operationalEfficiencyScore, shareholderStructureScore, marketSentimentScore
- Added 8 sub-score columns (integer, nullable): cashRunwayScore, solvencyScore, efficiencyScore, pedigreeSubScore, dilutionPenaltyScore, insiderAlignmentScore, liquidityScore, newsVelocityScore
- Added 4 weight columns (doublePrecision, nullable): p1Weight, p2Weight, p3Weight, p4Weight
- Updated ScoreHistoryEntry interface to match new schema structure
- Added TODO comments and temporary placeholder values in saveScoreToHistory and getScoreHistory functions (will be replaced in VS2-009 and VS2-011)
- Kept existing columns: id, stockTicker, overallScore, calculatedAt
- Kept existing indexes on stockTicker and calculatedAt
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When altering a schema table, all TypeScript interfaces and service functions that reference the old schema must be updated to prevent build errors
  - Added doublePrecision import to pg-core imports for weight columns
  - Temporary placeholder values allow the codebase to remain in a working state while the full 4-pillar calculation logic is implemented in later stories
  - TODO comments clearly mark areas that will be updated in future stories (VS2-009, VS2-011)
  - Schema migrations like this should be carefully coordinated with service layer updates to avoid breaking changes

## VS2-004: Implement P1 Financial Survival calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented financialSurvivalScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, cashRunway, solvency } or null if all inputs are null
- Cash Runway sub-metric (60% weight): handles profitable companies (monthly_burn <= 0 → score 100), zero cash (cash === 0 → score 0), and normal calculation (months = cash / monthly_burn, normalized to 18 months = 100)
- Solvency sub-metric (40% weight): handles zero assets (→ score 0), zero debt (→ score 100), and normal calculation (ratio = total_debt / total_assets, score = max(0, 100 - ratio * 200))
- Final score combines both sub-metrics with weights (60% cash runway, 40% solvency)
- Handles partial data scenarios: if only one sub-metric is available, uses that metric alone
- Returns null if ALL inputs are null, enabling null pillar weight redistribution in later stories
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Financial Survival pillar is crucial for early-stage companies with limited cash runway
  - Profitable companies (negative monthly_burn) get full 100 score for cash runway to reward cash generation
  - Null pillar handling allows flexible scoring when financial data is incomplete
  - Used Math.min() and Math.max() to clamp scores to 0-100 range
  - Separated sub-metric calculation logic for clarity and maintainability

## VS2-005: Implement P2 Operational Efficiency calculator
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Details:
- Implemented operationalEfficiencyScore() function in src/services/vetr-score.service.ts
- Returns { score, efficiencyRatio } or null if all inputs are null
- Sector-specific formulas:
  - Mining sector (contains 'Mining', 'Gold', 'Resource'): ratio = exploration_exp / total_opex
  - Tech sector (contains 'Tech', 'Software'): ratio = r_and_d_exp / total_opex
  - General/all other sectors: ratio = (revenue - g_and_a_expense) / revenue
- Edge case handling:
  - If total_opex === 0 → score 50 (neutral score for no operating expenses)
  - If revenue === 0 for general sector → score 0 (no revenue, no efficiency)
  - If ratio > 1 → score 100 (capped at maximum)
- Normalization: score = min(100, ratio / 0.70 * 100) where target ratio 0.70 = 100 score
- Returns null if all required inputs for the sector are null, enabling null pillar weight redistribution
- Build passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sector-specific logic requires case-insensitive string matching on sector names
  - Different sectors optimize for different metrics (mining=exploration, tech=R&D, general=gross margin)
  - Edge cases like zero opex or zero revenue need specific handling to avoid division by zero
  - Null pillar handling allows flexible scoring when sector-specific data is incomplete
  - The 0.70 normalization target represents a 70% efficiency ratio as "excellent" (100 score)
  - Separated edge case checks before main ratio calculation for code clarity
