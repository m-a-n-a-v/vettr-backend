## OPS-001: Create generic admin CRUD service
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Created src/services/admin-crud.service.ts with AdminCrudService class
- Implemented listRecords<T>() with pagination (limit/offset), search (ILIKE across configured columns), sort (column:direction), and filters (exact match on configured columns)
- Implemented getById<T>() that throws NotFoundError when record doesn't exist
- Implemented createRecord<T>() using Drizzle's insert().values().returning()
- Implemented updateRecord<T>() that checks existence first, then updates
- Implemented deleteRecord() that checks existence first, returns { deleted: true }
- All methods are generic and work with any PgTable from Drizzle
- Used drizzle-orm operators: eq, ilike, or, and, asc, desc
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/services/admin-crud.service.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle ORM patterns: Use table[column] as any for dynamic column access in generic functions
- The db export from config/database.ts can be null, so services must check before use
- PaginationMeta type from src/types/pagination.ts has { total, limit, offset, has_more }
- Error classes from src/utils/errors.ts: NotFoundError, ValidationError, etc.
- All TypeScript ESM imports must use .js extension in import paths
---
## OPS-002: Create admin CRUD route factory
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Created src/routes/admin-crud.factory.ts with createAdminCrudRoutes function
- Implemented GET / route that calls AdminCrudService.listRecords with query params (limit, offset, search, sort, filter_*)
- Implemented GET /:id route that calls AdminCrudService.getById and returns success(record)
- Implemented POST / route that calls AdminCrudService.createRecord and returns success(record) with 201 status
- Implemented PUT /:id route that calls AdminCrudService.updateRecord and returns success(record)
- Implemented DELETE /:id route that calls AdminCrudService.deleteRecord and returns success({ deleted: true })
- Added validateListParams function to validate limit (1-100), offset (>=0), and sort format (column:asc|desc)
- Added extractFilters function to extract filter_* params from query string
- All routes use paginated() or success() response helpers from src/utils/response.ts
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin-crud.factory.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Hono router patterns: new Hono() creates a router, c.req.query() gets query params, c.req.param() gets route params, c.req.json() parses body
- Query parameter validation: Use ValidationError from src/utils/errors.ts for invalid params
- Filter extraction pattern: filter_* prefix in query params maps to actual column names
- Response helpers: paginated() for list endpoints, success() for single records, 201 status for POST
- CrudRouteConfig interface defines the contract for table configuration (tableName, table, primaryKey, searchableColumns, filterableColumns, sortableColumns)
---

## OPS-003: Add CSV/JSON export endpoint to CRUD factory
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Added GET /export route to the admin CRUD factory router
- Implemented format parameter (csv|json, default json) with validation
- Implemented escapeCsvValue() function that properly escapes commas, quotes, and newlines by wrapping in double quotes and escaping existing quotes as double-double-quotes
- Implemented generateCsv() function that creates CSV with header row from object keys and data rows from values
- Export endpoint fetches ALL matching records (limit 100000, offset 0) using the same search, sort, and filter params as the list endpoint
- CSV format: sets Content-Type to text/csv and Content-Disposition header with filename={tableName}-export.csv
- JSON format: sets Content-Type to application/json and returns raw array of records (no pagination wrapper)
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin-crud.factory.ts (modified - added export endpoint and CSV generation functions)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Hono response patterns: c.header() sets response headers, c.body() sends raw string response, c.json() sends JSON
- CSV escaping rules: wrap in quotes if contains comma/quote/newline, escape quotes by doubling them
- Export endpoints should bypass pagination to return all matching records
- Content-Disposition header format: attachment; filename=name.ext triggers browser download
- All admin routes generated by the factory automatically inherit admin auth middleware when mounted in admin.routes.ts
---
## OPS-004: Add bulk operations to CRUD factory
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Added POST /bulk route to admin-crud.factory.ts for bulk creating multiple records
- Implemented validation for body.records: must be non-empty array
- POST /bulk inserts all records using db.insert(table).values(records) and returns success({ created: count })
- Added DELETE /bulk route for bulk deleting records by IDs
- Implemented validation for body.ids: must be non-empty array of strings
- DELETE /bulk uses inArray operator on the primary key column to delete all matching records
- Both endpoints return ValidationError (422) if validation fails
- Added required imports: inArray from drizzle-orm and db from config/database.js
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin-crud.factory.ts (modified - added POST /bulk and DELETE /bulk routes)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle bulk insert pattern: db.insert(table).values(array) accepts an array of objects for bulk insertion
- Drizzle bulk delete pattern: db.delete(table).where(inArray(primaryKeyColumn, idsArray)) for deleting multiple records
- inArray operator from drizzle-orm is the equivalent of SQL's IN clause for array matching
- ValidationError should be thrown for empty arrays or missing required fields in request body
- For bulk operations, we can return the count of affected records directly from the array length
---
## OPS-005: Update CORS to allow ops dashboard origin
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Updated CORS configuration in src/app.ts to support multiple comma-separated origins
- Implemented origin parsing logic: splits CORS_ORIGIN by comma, trims whitespace, and creates a function to check against the allowed origins list
- Maintains backward compatibility: when CORS_ORIGIN is '*', it passes the wildcard directly to the cors() middleware
- When CORS_ORIGIN contains multiple origins (e.g., 'http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000'), the middleware now accepts requests from any origin in the list
- The default CORS_ORIGIN value in src/config/env.ts remains '*' for backward compatibility with mobile clients
- Preflight OPTIONS requests will receive correct Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers based on the requesting origin
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/app.ts (modified - added CORS origin parsing logic)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Hono's cors() middleware accepts either a string or a function for the origin option
- When using a function, it receives the origin string from the request and should return the origin to allow (or null/false to deny)
- CORS origin parsing pattern: split by comma, trim whitespace, check against allowed list
- The cors middleware credentials: true option allows cookies and credentials to be sent cross-origin
- Wildcard '*' should be passed directly as a string, not as a function, for maximum compatibility
---
## OPS-006: Register admin CRUD routes for users table
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Registered CRUD routes for the users table in src/routes/admin.routes.ts
- Imported createAdminCrudRoutes from ./admin-crud.factory.js and users table from ../db/schema/index.js
- Created users routes with config: tableName 'users', primaryKey 'id', searchableColumns ['email', 'displayName'], filterableColumns ['tier', 'authProvider'], sortableColumns ['email', 'displayName', 'tier', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt']
- Mounted the users routes at /users path using adminRoutes.route('/users', usersRoutes)
- Full path is now /v1/admin/users with all CRUD operations: GET /, GET /:id, POST /, PUT /:id, DELETE /:id, GET /export, POST /bulk, DELETE /bulk
- Users can be searched by email and displayName with ?search=query parameter
- Users can be filtered by tier and authProvider with ?filter_tier=value and ?filter_authProvider=value
- Users can be sorted by email, displayName, tier, createdAt, updatedAt with ?sort=column:asc|desc
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin.routes.ts (modified - added users CRUD routes registration)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Route mounting pattern: adminRoutes.route('/path', subrouter) mounts a Hono sub-router at the specified path
- The createAdminCrudRoutes factory returns a complete Hono router with all CRUD endpoints already configured
- Since admin auth middleware is applied globally via adminRoutes.use('*', adminAuthMiddleware), all mounted sub-routes automatically inherit it
- Column names in searchableColumns, filterableColumns, and sortableColumns should match the actual database column names (camelCase in the schema definition)
- The users table has columns: id, email, displayName, avatarUrl, tier, passwordHash, authProvider, authProviderId, createdAt, updatedAt

- Mounted the stocks routes at /stocks path using adminRoutes.route('/stocks', stocksRoutes)
- Full path is now /v1/admin/stocks with all CRUD operations: GET /, GET /:id, POST /, PUT /:id, DELETE /:id, GET /export, POST /bulk, DELETE /bulk
- Stocks can be searched by ticker and name with ?search=query parameter
- Stocks can be filtered by exchange and sector with ?filter_exchange=value and ?filter_sector=value
- Stocks can be sorted by ticker, name, exchange, sector, marketCap, price, vetrScore, updatedAt with ?sort=column:asc|desc
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin.routes.ts (modified - added stocks CRUD routes registration)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The stocks table has snake_case column names in the database (market_cap, price_change, vetr_score, updated_at) but camelCase in the Drizzle schema (marketCap, priceChange, vetrScore, updatedAt)
- When configuring sortableColumns, filterableColumns, and searchableColumns, always use the camelCase names from the schema definition, not the database column names
- The stocks table schema includes indexes on ticker, sector, and exchange for optimized filtering and searching
- Double precision columns (marketCap, price, priceChange) and integer columns (vetrScore) can be used for sorting and filtering
- The pattern for adding new table CRUD routes is consistent: import the table, create routes with createAdminCrudRoutes, mount with adminRoutes.route()

- Implemented redFlagAcknowledgments routes at /v1/admin/red-flag-acknowledgments with GET / (list with pagination, filterable by userId and redFlagId), POST / (create with { userId, redFlagId }), DELETE / (delete by composite key)
- All list endpoints return paginated response format using paginated() helper with { success, data: { items, pagination }, meta }
- POST endpoints return 201 status with created record wrapped in success()
- DELETE endpoints return success({ deleted: true }) and throw NotFoundError if record not found
- Used drizzle-orm's and(eq(column1, value1), eq(column2, value2)) for composite key lookups in WHERE clauses
- Added db null checks at the start of each route handler to satisfy TypeScript strict null checking
- Registered all three route groups in src/routes/admin.routes.ts with proper documentation comments
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin-composite-pk.routes.ts (created)
- src/routes/admin.routes.ts (modified - imported and registered composite PK routes)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Composite primary key tables require custom routes instead of the generic factory since they lack a single 'id' column
- Drizzle composite key pattern: and(eq(table.column1, value1), eq(table.column2, value2)) for WHERE clauses
- DELETE endpoints for composite PK tables should accept the composite key fields in the request body (not URL params)
- The db instance from config/database.ts can be null, so all route handlers need null checks: if (!db) throw new Error('Database not initialized')
- For composite PK tables, pagination works the same way as single-PK tables using sql<number>\`count(*)::int\` for total count
- All three composite PK tables have timestamp fields (addedAt, readAt, acknowledgedAt) which are good default sort fields using desc()
- The pattern for composite PK routes: export named Hono router instances instead of calling createAdminCrudRoutes factory

## OPS-018: Specialized admin action endpoints
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Added POST /v1/admin/users/:id/change-tier endpoint in src/routes/admin.routes.ts
- Implemented tier validation (free, pro, premium) with ValidationError for invalid values
- Endpoint updates user.tier column and returns { id, email, tier } in success response
- Added POST /v1/admin/stocks/:ticker/recalculate-score endpoint
- Implemented stock lookup by ticker with NotFoundError for non-existent stocks
- Invokes calculateVetrScore() from vetr-score.service.ts to recalculate score
- Updates stock.vetrScore field and creates new vetrScoreHistory record (done automatically by calculateVetrScore)
- Returns full score result with overall_score, components, bonus_points, penalty_points, calculated_at
- Added POST /v1/admin/seed/run endpoint
- Imports and calls runAllSeeds() from db/seed/index.js
- Returns success response with message and summary of seeded counts (stocks, filings, executives)
- All three endpoints inherit admin auth protection from adminRoutes.use('*', adminAuthMiddleware)
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin.routes.ts (modified - added three specialized endpoints)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Specialized admin endpoints can be added directly in admin.routes.ts for operations that don't fit the CRUD pattern
- The calculateVetrScore() function automatically saves to vetrScoreHistory and caches results, so no manual saving needed
- The runAllSeeds() function from db/seed/index.js handles all seeding logic including clearing and re-seeding tables
- When updating a stock's vetrScore field after recalculation, use db.update(stocks).set({ vetrScore }).where(eq(stocks.ticker, ticker))
- ValidationError should be used for input validation failures (invalid enum values, etc.)
- NotFoundError should be used when a resource doesn't exist (user ID, stock ticker, etc.)
- Type casting is needed for TypeScript when setting enum-like fields: tier as 'free' | 'pro' | 'premium'
- The seed endpoint can get counts after seeding by querying each table with db.select().from(table)

## OPS-019: Admin analytics endpoints
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend
Details:
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/user-growth endpoint that queries users table grouped by DATE(created_at) for last 90 days
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/score-distribution endpoint that queries vetrScoreHistory for latest score per ticker, buckets scores into 5 ranges (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100)
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/red-flag-trends endpoint that queries redFlagHistory grouped by DATE(detected_at) and severity for last 30 days
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/filing-activity endpoint that queries filings grouped by DATE(created_at) for last 30 days
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/alert-activity endpoint that queries alerts grouped by DATE(triggered_at) for last 30 days
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/tier-breakdown endpoint that queries users grouped by tier column
- Added GET /v1/admin/analytics/stock-health endpoint that returns 10 stocks with lowest vetrScore and 10 stocks with most red flags
- All 7 analytics endpoints implemented in src/routes/admin.routes.ts using raw SQL via drizzle-orm's sql template tag
- All endpoints return data in the standard success() response format: { success: true, data: {...}, meta: {...} }
- All endpoints inherit admin auth protection from adminRoutes.use('*', adminAuthMiddleware)
- All local imports use .js extension (ESM requirement)
- npm run build and npm run typecheck both pass
Files changed:
- src/routes/admin.routes.ts (modified - added 7 analytics endpoints)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Raw SQL queries in Drizzle: Use db.execute(sql`...`) for complex aggregations, GROUP BY, and window functions
- The sql template tag from drizzle-orm allows embedding raw SQL while maintaining type safety
- Cast PostgreSQL aggregates to int: COUNT(*)::int ensures integer return type instead of bigint
- Date grouping pattern: DATE(column_name) groups timestamps by date, useful for time series charts
- Window functions for latest records: SELECT DISTINCT ON (partition_column) ... ORDER BY partition_column, sort_column DESC gets the latest record per partition
- CASE WHEN for bucketing: Use CASE WHEN score BETWEEN x AND y THEN 'range' to bucket numeric values into ranges
- LEFT JOIN for counts: LEFT JOIN with COUNT gives zero counts for stocks with no red flags (vs INNER JOIN which excludes them)
- All analytics queries return arrays mapped to { date, count }, { range, count }, or { ticker, name, score/count } shapes
- PostgreSQL interval syntax: NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days' filters to last N days
- The result.rows from db.execute() returns an array of objects that need to be mapped to the desired shape with type assertions (row: any)

## OPS-020: Initialize Vite React TypeScript project for ops dashboard
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Initialized new Vite React TypeScript project at /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/
- Created package.json with all required production dependencies: react, react-dom, react-router v7, @tanstack/react-query v5, recharts v2, axios, react-hot-toast
- Created package.json with all required dev dependencies: @types/react, @types/react-dom, typescript, @vitejs/plugin-react, tailwindcss v4, @tailwindcss/vite, vite
- Configured vite.config.ts with React plugin, @tailwindcss/vite plugin, and server proxy for /v1 forwarding to http://localhost:3000/v1 with changeOrigin: true
- Set up TailwindCSS v4 in src/index.css using @import 'tailwindcss' directive (v4 uses CSS-based config instead of tailwind.config.js)
- Created minimal src/App.tsx with centered content showing "VETTR Ops Dashboard" title and description using Tailwind classes (bg-gray-900, text-white, text-4xl, etc.)
- Created src/main.tsx that renders App component into root element using ReactDOM.createRoot
- Created tsconfig.json with React JSX transform (jsx: "react-jsx"), strict mode enabled, and bundler moduleResolution
- Created tsconfig.node.json for Vite config compilation
- Created index.html as entry point with root div and module script tag
- Created .gitignore to exclude node_modules, dist, and editor files
- npm run build passes successfully with TypeScript compilation and Vite production build
Files changed:
- package.json (created)
- tsconfig.json (created)
- tsconfig.node.json (created)
- vite.config.ts (created)
- index.html (created)
- src/index.css (created)
- src/App.tsx (created)
- src/main.tsx (created)
- .gitignore (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Vite project structure: index.html at root, src/ for source files, vite.config.ts for configuration
- TailwindCSS v4 breaking change: Uses @import 'tailwindcss' in CSS instead of @tailwind directives from v3
- TailwindCSS v4 uses @tailwindcss/vite plugin instead of PostCSS plugin architecture
- React 18 with new JSX transform: No need to import React in component files, jsx: "react-jsx" in tsconfig handles it
- TypeScript strict mode catches unused imports: Remove React import when not using React.createElement or React types
- Vite proxy configuration pattern: server.proxy['/v1'] forwards API requests to backend, changeOrigin: true required for virtual hosts
- React Router v7 is the latest version (successor to v6), installed via react-router package
- @tanstack/react-query v5 is the latest version (formerly react-query), used for server state management
- Frontend does NOT need .js extensions in imports (Vite/TypeScript handles resolution automatically, unlike backend ESM)
- The frontend project uses a separate Git repository from the backend (separate commit history)
- Frontend build command: tsc && vite build (TypeScript check first, then Vite bundle for production)
---
## OPS-021: Create API client with admin auth interceptor
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/lib/api.ts with configured Axios API client
- Created Axios instance with baseURL '/v1' (which Vite proxy forwards to localhost:3000/v1)
- Implemented request interceptor that reads 'admin_secret' from sessionStorage and adds X-Admin-Secret header to every request
- Implemented response interceptor that handles 401 status by clearing sessionStorage and redirecting to /login
- Exported typed helper functions: apiGet<T>(), apiPost<T>(), apiPut<T>(), apiDelete<T>() that wrap the axios instance and return response.data typed as T
- Exported the raw axios instance as default export for direct access when needed
- All API calls will now automatically include the admin secret header and handle authentication failures
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/lib/api.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Axios interceptor patterns: request interceptor for adding headers, response interceptor for error handling
- sessionStorage.getItem('admin_secret') retrieves the stored admin secret for authenticated requests
- window.location.href = '/login' triggers a full page redirect (React Router will handle the /login route)
- InternalAxiosRequestConfig type is used for request interceptor config parameter in Axios v1.x
- AxiosError type provides typed error objects with response.status for status code checking
- Helper functions that return response.data simplify API calls by unwrapping the Axios response envelope
- Frontend does NOT need .js extensions in imports (unlike backend ESM requirement)
- Vite proxy configuration in vite.config.ts handles forwarding /v1 requests to the backend server
---

## OPS-022: Create login page with admin secret authentication
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/pages/Login.tsx with authentication form
- Implemented password input field for admin secret with form validation
- Implemented handleSubmit function that calls GET /v1/admin/metrics with X-Admin-Secret header to verify credentials
- On successful authentication (200 response): stores secret in sessionStorage and navigates to '/' using React Router's useNavigate
- On authentication failure (401/403): displays "Invalid admin secret" error message in red
- On other errors: displays "Failed to connect to the server" error message
- Implemented loading state with animated spinner and disabled button during authentication request
- Styled with TailwindCSS: dark gray background (bg-gray-900), white card (bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl), centered layout with flex
- Form includes proper labels, focus states (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500), and disabled states
- Button shows loading spinner animation during authentication with "Authenticating..." text
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Login.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- React Router v7: Use useNavigate hook from 'react-router' (not 'react-router-dom') for programmatic navigation
- sessionStorage.setItem('admin_secret', secret) stores the admin secret for use in API interceptor
- Axios error handling: err.response?.status provides HTTP status code, err.response?.data contains error details
- Loading spinner pattern: Use animate-spin class on SVG for rotation animation, show loading text during async operations
- Form disabled state: disabled={isLoading || !secret} prevents submission while loading or when input is empty
- TailwindCSS focus states: focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 creates accessible focus indicators
- Error display pattern: Conditional rendering with {error && <div>...</div>} shows errors only when present
- Frontend imports: No .js extension needed (Vite handles module resolution automatically)
- React Router v7 imports: 'react-router' package provides useNavigate, not 'react-router-dom'
---

## OPS-023: Create app layout with sidebar navigation
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/components/Layout.tsx with responsive sidebar navigation
- Implemented fixed-width sidebar (w-64) with navigation links for all 16 admin sections (Dashboard, Users, Stocks, Executives, Filings, Alert Rules, Alerts, Watchlist Items, VETR Scores, Red Flags, Red Flag Acks, Sync History, User Settings, Refresh Tokens, Filing Reads, Bulk Import)
- Used React Router's NavLink component with active class highlighting (bg-blue-700 text-white for active, text-gray-300 for inactive)
- Implemented header bar with dynamic page title based on current route using useLocation hook
- Added Logout button that clears sessionStorage.removeItem('admin_secret') and navigates to /login
- Implemented mobile-responsive sidebar: hidden by default on mobile (< 768px), toggleable via hamburger menu button
- Added mobile overlay (bg-black bg-opacity-50) that closes sidebar when clicked outside
- Used <Outlet /> from React Router to render child route components in main content area
- Styled with TailwindCSS: dark sidebar (bg-gray-900 text-white), light content area (bg-gray-50), smooth transitions
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/components/Layout.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- React Router v7: NavLink component accepts className as a function that receives { isActive } for conditional styling
- Mobile responsive pattern: Use transform translate-x classes with md: breakpoint prefix for sidebar visibility
- Sidebar overlay pattern: Fixed overlay with z-index layering (sidebar z-50, overlay z-40, content z-0)
- useState for sidebar toggle state: isSidebarOpen controls mobile sidebar visibility, hamburger button toggles it
- Dynamic page titles: Create a pageTitles record mapping paths to titles, use useLocation().pathname to get current path
- React Router v7 imports: useNavigate, useLocation, NavLink, Outlet all from 'react-router' package
- TailwindCSS transition classes: transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out for smooth sidebar animations
- Logout pattern: Clear sessionStorage and use navigate('/login') for programmatic navigation
- Frontend directory: All frontend commits should be made in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/

## OPS-024: Configure React Router with protected routes
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx that checks sessionStorage for 'admin_secret'
- Created src/router.tsx with createBrowserRouter from React Router v7
- Defined unprotected /login route and all protected routes nested under ProtectedRoute and Layout components
- Created 17 placeholder page components for all admin sections (Dashboard, Users, UserDetail, Stocks, Executives, Filings, AlertRules, Alerts, WatchlistItems, VetrScores, RedFlags, RedFlagAcks, SyncHistory, UserSettings, RefreshTokens, FilingReads, BulkImport)
- All placeholder pages render basic heading and description with TailwindCSS styling
- Updated src/App.tsx to use QueryClientProvider with configured QueryClient (5 min staleTime, no refetch on window focus, retry: 1)
- Added RouterProvider with the router configuration
- Added Toaster component from react-hot-toast for notifications
- ProtectedRoute redirects to /login when admin_secret is not found in sessionStorage
- Browser back/forward navigation works correctly with all routes
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx (created)
- src/router.tsx (created)
- src/App.tsx (modified - replaced placeholder content with QueryClientProvider, RouterProvider, and Toaster)
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (created)
- src/pages/Users.tsx (created)
- src/pages/UserDetail.tsx (created)
- src/pages/Stocks.tsx (created)
- src/pages/Executives.tsx (created)
- src/pages/Filings.tsx (created)
- src/pages/AlertRules.tsx (created)
- src/pages/Alerts.tsx (created)
- src/pages/WatchlistItems.tsx (created)
- src/pages/VetrScores.tsx (created)
- src/pages/RedFlags.tsx (created)
- src/pages/RedFlagAcks.tsx (created)
- src/pages/SyncHistory.tsx (created)
- src/pages/UserSettings.tsx (created)
- src/pages/RefreshTokens.tsx (created)
- src/pages/FilingReads.tsx (created)
- src/pages/BulkImport.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- React Router v7: createBrowserRouter is the recommended way to create routers (not BrowserRouter with Routes)
- ProtectedRoute pattern: Use <Navigate to="/login" replace /> to redirect unauthenticated users
- React Router v7: Nested routes use Outlet component - ProtectedRoute and Layout both render <Outlet /> for their children
- Route nesting: ProtectedRoute wraps Layout, Layout wraps all page routes - this creates the auth check → layout wrapper → page content hierarchy
- React Router v7 imports: All router components (Navigate, Outlet, NavLink, useNavigate, useLocation) from 'react-router' package (not 'react-router-dom')
- Default vs named exports: Layout and Login use default exports, so import them without curly braces
- QueryClient configuration: Set staleTime to reduce unnecessary refetches, disable refetchOnWindowFocus for admin dashboards
- Toaster positioning: Will be configured in later stories, but component must be included in App.tsx root
- Placeholder pages pattern: Simple function components with heading and description text, all using export function syntax (named exports)
- All frontend code compiles without .js extensions in imports (Vite handles module resolution automatically)
---
## OPS-025: Create shared UI components library
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/components/ui/StatCard.tsx with icon, title, value, and optional change props
- StatCard displays metric cards with green/red percentage change indicators based on positive/negative values
- Created src/components/ui/Badge.tsx with variant (success, warning, error, info) and label props
- Badge component uses distinct color schemes for each variant (green, yellow, red, blue) using TailwindCSS
- Created src/components/ui/FormField.tsx with label, name, type, value, onChange, error, and placeholder props
- FormField renders labeled input with error display in red text below the input when error is present
- Created src/components/ui/Modal.tsx with isOpen, onClose, title, and children props
- Modal renders fixed overlay with centered white card, clickable overlay background to close, X close button in header
- Created src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx extending Modal with message, onConfirm, confirmLabel, and variant props
- ConfirmDialog renders message text with Cancel and Confirm buttons, danger variant styles Confirm button red
- Created barrel export at src/components/ui/index.ts exporting all five UI components
- All components styled with TailwindCSS utility classes for consistent theming
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/components/ui/StatCard.tsx (created)
- src/components/ui/Badge.tsx (created)
- src/components/ui/FormField.tsx (created)
- src/components/ui/Modal.tsx (created)
- src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx (created)
- src/components/ui/index.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- React component patterns: Named exports (export function ComponentName) are used for consistency
- TailwindCSS color variants: Use object mapping for variant-based className selection (e.g., variantClasses[variant])
- Modal overlay pattern: Fixed inset-0 div with bg-black bg-opacity-50 creates darkened overlay
- Modal centering: flex min-h-full items-center justify-center p-4 centers modal on screen
- Modal z-index: Use z-50 for modal content, overlay can be lower z-index but still above regular content
- TypeScript props: Interface definitions for component props ensure type safety
- Optional props: Use ? for optional props (change?, error?, placeholder?) with default values or undefined checks
- Children prop type: React.ReactNode is the correct type for component children
- Event handlers: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement> for input onChange events
- Conditional rendering: {error && <element>} pattern shows elements only when condition is truthy
- SVG icons inline: Simple X icon using SVG path for close button, avoids external icon library dependency
- Frontend imports: No .js extension needed in imports (Vite handles module resolution)
- FormField input border: Use border-red-300 class when error exists to highlight validation issues
- ConfirmDialog composition: Wraps Modal component and adds confirmation-specific UI and behavior
- Button styling patterns: Use focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 for accessible keyboard focus indicators
---
## OPS-026: Create generic DataTable component
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/components/DataTable.tsx with full-featured data table component
- Implemented column configuration with key, label, render function, and sortable flag
- Implemented sortable table headers with visual sort indicators (up/down arrows)
- Clicking sortable header toggles between asc/desc and calls onSort callback
- Implemented row rendering that uses column.render for custom rendering or defaults to stringified value
- Added checkbox column for row selection with "select all" checkbox in header that toggles all visible rows
- Individual row checkboxes toggle selection state, tracked in Set<string> for efficient lookup
- Added indeterminate checkbox state when some (but not all) rows are selected
- Implemented actions column with Edit and Delete icon buttons that call onEdit/onDelete callbacks
- Created pagination controls below table with page size selector (10/25/50 options)
- Pagination shows "Showing X-Y of Z records" text and previous/next buttons
- Previous/next buttons disabled appropriately when at boundaries (offset=0 or has_more=false)
- Implemented loading skeleton with 6 rows of animated gray bars using animate-pulse
- Implemented empty state with centered icon and "No records found" message when data array is empty
- Table is horizontally scrollable on small screens using overflow-x-auto
- All state managed internally: selectedRows, sortColumn, sortDirection
- Selection changes trigger onSelectionChange callback with array of selected IDs
- TypeScript interfaces defined for Column, Pagination, and DataTableProps with generics
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/components/DataTable.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- React Set for selection state: Set<string> provides O(1) lookup for checking if row is selected
- Checkbox indeterminate state: Must use ref callback to set input.indeterminate = true (not a prop)
- TypeScript generics for table data: DataTable<T extends Record<string, any>> allows type-safe row data
- useEffect dependency arrays: Include callbacks in deps or wrap in useCallback to avoid stale closures
- Reset selection on data change: useEffect with data in deps clears selection when table data changes
- Loading skeleton pattern: Array.from({ length: 6 }) creates placeholder rows during loading state
- Empty state colspan: Calculate total columns including checkbox and actions columns for full-width empty message
- SVG icons inline: Use inline SVG for edit/delete icons to avoid external dependencies
- Sort icon rotation: Use different SVG paths for up/down arrows instead of CSS transform
- Disabled button styling: disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed for visual feedback
- Table hover states: hover:bg-gray-50 on tr elements for better row visibility
- Pagination calculation: currentStart = offset + 1, currentEnd = min(offset + limit, total)
- Frontend TypeScript: No .js extension needed in imports (Vite handles module resolution)
- React.ReactNode type: Correct type for render function return values and children props
---
## OPS-027: Create search, filter, and export toolbar components
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/components/SearchInput.tsx with text input, search icon, and debounced onChange (300ms delay)
- Implemented clear (X) button that appears when input has value and resets the search
- Created src/components/FilterBar.tsx accepting filters prop with dynamic select dropdowns
- Implemented onFilterChange callback that fires when any dropdown changes with current filter state
- Added "Clear Filters" button that resets all dropdowns and only appears when filters are active
- Created src/components/ExportButton.tsx with dropdown menu showing CSV and JSON export options
- Implemented loading state with spinner animation inside button during export operations
- Created src/components/BulkActionBar.tsx showing selected count and Delete Selected button
- BulkActionBar styled as sticky bar at top with distinct blue background, only visible when selectedCount > 0
- All components use TailwindCSS utility classes for consistent styling and spacing
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/components/SearchInput.tsx (created)
- src/components/FilterBar.tsx (created)
- src/components/ExportButton.tsx (created)
- src/components/BulkActionBar.tsx (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Debounced search pattern: Use useEffect with setTimeout to delay API calls, clean up timer in return function
- useEffect cleanup: Return a cleanup function that calls clearTimeout(timer) to cancel pending timers on unmount or value change
- Controlled input pattern: Track input value in local state, fire callback after debounce delay
- Filter state management: Track selected filters in Record<string, string>, delete keys when set to empty string
- Dropdown menu pattern: Fixed overlay div covers screen to detect outside clicks, absolute positioned menu relative to button
- Z-index layering: Fixed overlay at z-10, dropdown menu at z-20 to ensure proper stacking
- Sticky positioning: Use sticky top-0 for BulkActionBar to keep it visible when scrolling table
- Conditional rendering: Return null from component when not needed (selectedCount === 0) instead of hiding with CSS
- SVG icon inline pattern: Use inline SVG paths for icons to avoid external dependencies (search, download, delete, check circle)
- Loading state UI: Show spinner animation with "Exporting..." text while loading prop is true, disable button
- TypeScript interface exports: No need to export interfaces used only within component file
- Frontend imports: No .js extension needed (Vite handles module resolution automatically)
- Filter dropdown styling: Use border border-gray-300 rounded-lg with focus:ring-2 for consistent form controls
- Clear button visibility: Use conditional rendering {hasActiveFilters && <button>} pattern for optional UI elements

## OPS-028: Create generic useTable hook for CRUD operations
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/hooks/useTable.ts with generic useTable<T> hook for data fetching and CRUD operations
- Implemented useQuery from @tanstack/react-query for fetching paginated data from GET /v1/admin/{endpoint}
- Query key includes [queryKey, page, pageSize, search, sort, filters] to auto-refetch when any param changes
- Implemented buildParams() helper to construct query params: limit, offset, search, sort (column:direction), and filter_* params spread from filters object
- Implemented createMutation using useMutation to POST /v1/admin/{endpoint} with onSuccess invalidating queries and showing toast
- Implemented updateMutation using useMutation to PUT /v1/admin/{endpoint}/:id with { id, data } params
- Implemented deleteMutation using useMutation to DELETE /v1/admin/{endpoint}/:id
- Implemented bulkDeleteMutation using useMutation to DELETE /v1/admin/{endpoint}/bulk with { ids } body
- All mutations include onSuccess callbacks that call queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [queryKey] })
- All mutations include onError callbacks that extract error messages from err.response?.data?.error?.message and show toast.error()
- Success toasts show "{Action} {endpoint} successfully" messages (e.g., "Created users successfully")
- Hook returns: data (items array), pagination (PaginationMeta), isLoading, error, search/setSearch, sort/setSort, filters/setFilters, page/setPage, pageSize/setPageSize, all mutations, and refetch function
- TypeScript interfaces defined for TableConfig, PaginationMeta, ApiResponse<T>, and SingleApiResponse<T>
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/hooks/useTable.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Query v5 patterns: useQuery with queryKey array, useMutation with mutationFn/onSuccess/onError
- Query invalidation: queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [queryKey] }) refetches all queries matching the key
- Toast notifications: toast.success() and toast.error() from react-hot-toast for user feedback
- Axios error handling: err.response?.data?.error?.message extracts backend error messages
- Pagination offset calculation: offset = (page - 1) * pageSize for zero-based API offset
- Query params for filters: filter_* prefix pattern matches backend filter param expectations
- Generic TypeScript hook: useTable<T extends Record<string, any>> allows type-safe table data
- React state for table controls: useState for page, pageSize, search, sort, filters
- Mutation parameters: Update mutation needs { id, data } structure, delete needs just id string
- Bulk operations: bulkDeleteMutation accepts ids array and extracts count from response.data.deleted
- Frontend directory: All frontend commits in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/
- No .js extensions needed in frontend imports (Vite handles module resolution)

## OPS-029: Create useExport hook for file downloads
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/hooks/useExport.ts with useExport(endpoint: string) hook
- Implemented exportData(format: 'csv' | 'json', filters?: Record<string, string>) function
- Implemented isExporting state that is true during download request and false when complete
- exportData calls GET /v1/admin/{endpoint}/export?format={format} with filters as query params
- Uses axios with responseType: 'blob' to download binary data
- On success: creates Blob from response data, creates object URL with URL.createObjectURL()
- Creates temporary <a> element with href=objectURL and download attribute set to {endpoint}-export.{format}
- Programmatically clicks the link to trigger browser download
- Cleans up by removing the link element and revoking the object URL with URL.revokeObjectURL()
- Shows success toast notification when download completes
- On error: extracts error message from blob response (reads blob as text, parses JSON) or axios error
- Shows error toast notification with extracted error message
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/hooks/useExport.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Blob download pattern: Use responseType: 'blob' in axios to receive binary data for file downloads
- Object URL creation: URL.createObjectURL(blob) creates a temporary URL that can be used in <a> href
- Programmatic download: Create temporary <a> element, set href and download attributes, call click(), then remove
- URL cleanup: Always call URL.revokeObjectURL() after download to release memory
- Blob error handling: When API returns error as blob (not JSON), read blob.text() and parse as JSON to extract error message
- Filter params pattern: Add filter_ prefix to filter object keys when passing to API (matches backend expectations)
- React state management: useState for isExporting boolean, set true before request, false in finally block
- Toast notifications: toast.success() for successful downloads, toast.error() for failures
- Frontend imports: No .js extension needed in imports (Vite handles module resolution)
- Working directory: Frontend stories use /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/ for commits

## OPS-030: Create useAnalytics hooks for dashboard data
Status: COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard
Details:
- Created src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts with 8 dedicated analytics hooks
- Implemented useMetrics() hook with queryKey ['metrics'] fetching GET /v1/admin/metrics
- Implemented useUserGrowth() hook with queryKey ['analytics', 'user-growth'] for 90-day user growth data
- Implemented useScoreDistribution() hook for VETR score distribution buckets
- Implemented useRedFlagTrends() hook for 30-day red flag trends by severity
- Implemented useFilingActivity() hook for 30-day filing activity data
- Implemented useAlertActivity() hook for 30-day alert activity data
- Implemented useTierBreakdown() hook for user tier distribution
- Implemented useStockHealth() hook returning lowest scores and most flagged stocks
- All hooks use @tanstack/react-query's useQuery for data fetching and caching
- All hooks extract data from standard API response shape: response.data.data (API returns { success, data, meta })
- Added comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for all analytics data structures
- Each hook has JSDoc comments explaining its purpose and return data structure
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts (created)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TanStack Query caching: Each hook has unique queryKey array for independent caching (e.g., ['analytics', 'user-growth'])
- API response extraction pattern: response.data.data extracts the nested data from { success, data: { data: [...] }, meta } structure
- TypeScript interface organization: Define interfaces for each data type (UserGrowthData, ScoreDistributionData, etc.) for type safety
- Generic API response types: ApiResponse<T> interface wraps the standard { success, data: T, meta } shape
- Analytics data structures: User growth and activity data use { date, count } shape, breakdown data uses { category, count } shape
- Stock health data: Combines two arrays (lowest_scores and most_flags) in a single response object
- Metrics data structure: Nested database_stats object contains counts for all tables, plus top-level performance metrics
- Hook naming convention: use{EntityName} pattern for clarity (useUserGrowth, useScoreDistribution, etc.)
- TanStack Query return type: useQuery returns { data, isLoading, error, refetch } for consumption by components
- Frontend imports: No .js extension needed in imports (Vite handles module resolution automatically)
- Working directory: All frontend commits in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/

- Each StatCard displays appropriate icon using inline SVG (users, chart, document, bell, clock, server icons)
- Added formatUptime() helper function to format uptime_seconds as days/hours/minutes (e.g., "5d 3h" or "12h" or "45m")
- Implemented loading skeleton state with 6 animated placeholder cards using animate-pulse
- Implemented error state with red error banner when metrics request fails
- Used responsive grid layout: 1 column on mobile, 2 on md, 3 on lg, 4 on xl breakpoints
- All metric values formatted with toLocaleString() for thousand separators
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (modified)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- TailwindCSS responsive grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 creates adaptive layout
- Loading skeleton pattern: Array spread [...Array(6)] creates placeholder elements, animate-pulse adds loading animation
- Optional chaining for safe access: metrics?.database_stats.users prevents crashes when data is undefined during loading
- Uptime formatting: Convert seconds to days/hours/minutes using Math.floor and modulo operations
- SVG icon inline pattern: Use inline SVG with stroke="currentColor" to inherit text color from Tailwind classes
- useMetrics() hook returns { data, isLoading, error } from TanStack Query for complete query state
- Error handling pattern: Check error state first and return early with error UI before rendering main content
- Frontend Dashboard component is already registered in router.tsx from OPS-024 (routes defined for all pages)
- The StatCard component displays optional change percentage but metrics endpoint doesn't provide change data yet

- Both charts show loading skeletons with animate-pulse while data loads
- Both charts show "No data available" empty state with icon when data arrays are empty
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (modified - added score distribution bar chart and tier breakdown pie chart)

**Learnings for future iterations:**

- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (modified - added red flag trends area chart, filing activity bar chart, and stock health tables)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Recharts AreaChart stacked pattern: Use stackId="1" on all Area components to create stacked areas, type="monotone" for smooth curves
- Data transformation for stacked charts: API returns { date, severity, count } rows, need to transform to { date, Low: x, Moderate: y, High: z, Critical: w } for Recharts stacked areas
- Map-based transformation: Use Map<string, Record<string, number>> to aggregate counts by date and severity, then convert to array

- Integrated useTable<User> hook with endpoint 'users' and queryKey 'admin-users' for data fetching and CRUD operations
- Implemented SearchInput component for searching by email and displayName (debounced)
- Implemented FilterBar with two filters: tier (free/pro/premium) and authProvider (email/google/apple)
- Implemented ExportButton with useExport hook for CSV/JSON exports
- Created DataTable with 5 columns: email, displayName (with null handling), tier (Badge with color variants), authProvider (capitalized), createdAt (formatted date)
- All columns except authProvider are sortable (email, displayName, tier, createdAt)
- Implemented Create User modal with form validation (email format, required fields)
- Implemented Edit User modal with same form fields, pre-populated with user data
- Form fields include: email (with validation), displayName (required), tier (select dropdown), authProvider (select dropdown)
- Implemented delete confirmation using ConfirmDialog with danger variant
- Implemented row selection with BulkActionBar showing count and bulk delete action
- All CRUD operations use mutations from useTable hook with proper error/success handling
- Success toast notifications shown after create/update/delete operations
- Error handling delegated to useTable hook mutations which show error toasts automatically
- Fixed TypeScript errors: SearchInput manages its own internal value state, ConfirmDialog doesn't accept title prop
- Removed unused variables (page, sort) to satisfy TypeScript strict mode
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Users.tsx (modified - complete CRUD implementation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- SearchInput component pattern: Manages its own internal state for value, takes only onSearch callback (no value prop needed)
- ConfirmDialog simplification: Uses hardcoded "Confirm Action" title in Modal, only takes message and variant props
- useTable hook returns destructured values: Don't destructure unused values like page/sort if not needed (TypeScript strict mode)
- Form validation pattern: Create validateForm() function that sets errors object, return boolean for valid/invalid
- Modal state management: Separate boolean state for each modal (isCreateModalOpen, isEditModalOpen, isDeleteDialogOpen)
- Form data initialization: Reset formData and formErrors when opening create modal, populate when opening edit modal
- Mutation success handling: Use try/catch with mutateAsync to handle both success (close modal, show toast) and errors (handled by hook)
- Badge variant mapping: tier='premium' → success, tier='pro' → info, tier='free' → warning for color coding
- BulkActionBar conditional rendering: Show only when selectedUserIds.length > 0, hide otherwise
- DataTable pagination: onPageChange receives offset, convert to page number with Math.floor(offset / pageSize) + 1
- Frontend directory: All frontend work in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/, commits made there
- Users page is already registered in router.tsx from OPS-024, so no router changes needed

- Displayed user profile info card with email, displayName, avatarUrl (with fallback avatar icon), tier (as Badge), authProvider, createdAt, updatedAt
- Implemented Change Tier section with three buttons (Free, Pro, Premium) using useMutation
- Tier change calls POST /v1/admin/users/:id/change-tier endpoint and shows toast notification on success
- Tier buttons are disabled when user already has that tier or during mutation (isPending state)
- Added three related data sections using separate useQuery calls with filter_userId:
  - Watchlist Items: shows stockId (truncated) and addedAt columns
  - Alert Rules: shows stockTicker, ruleType, isActive (Badge), frequency, lastTriggeredAt columns
  - Sync History: shows status (Badge), itemsSynced, startedAt, completedAt, errors columns
- Each related data section uses DataTable component for consistent display
- Implemented loading skeleton state with animate-pulse during initial user data fetch

- useQuery enabled option: Use enabled: !!id to prevent query execution when id is undefined
- Multiple useQuery calls: Can run multiple independent queries in parallel, each with unique queryKey
- apiGet with params object: Pass query params as second argument to apiGet (e.g., { filter_userId: id })
- PaginatedResponse extraction: API returns { success, data: { items, pagination }, meta }, extract items with response?.data.items || []
- useMutation isPending: Use isPending property (not isLoading) to check mutation status in TanStack Query v5
- Disabled button styling: Use conditional className with ternary operator for dynamic disabled styling based on current state
- Avatar fallback pattern: Use user icon SVG in gray circle when avatarUrl is null
- Related data sections: Fetch with separate queries, display in DataTable with subset of columns relevant for detail view
- Empty state messages: Show user-friendly messages when related data arrays are empty
- DataTable in detail views: Pass no-op callbacks (() => {}) for actions not needed in read-only sections
- Frontend directory: User detail page is frontend work, committed in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/
- The /users/:id route was already registered in router.tsx from OPS-024, so no router changes needed
- Working with nested API response shapes: Use optional chaining (response?.data) to safely access nested properties

- Implemented Create Stock modal with form validation (all fields required, number parsing for numeric fields)
- Implemented Edit Stock modal with same form fields, pre-populated with stock data
- Form fields include: ticker, name, exchange, sector, marketCap (number), price (number), priceChange (number), vetrScore (number)

- Fixed TypeScript error: removed unused response variable declaration
- Route already registered as /stocks in router.tsx from OPS-024
- npm run build passes with no TypeScript errors
Files changed:
- src/pages/Stocks.tsx (modified - complete CRUD implementation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**

- Market cap formatting: Use 1e9 and 1e6 for billions and millions checks, toFixed(1) for one decimal place
- Percentage formatting: Add + sign for positive values, - sign is automatic for negative values
- Badge variant logic: Extract into getScoreBadgeVariant() helper for reusability across components
- Recalculate Score pattern: Call specialized admin action endpoint POST /v1/admin/stocks/:ticker/recalculate-score, use per-row loading state (isRecalculating === ticker) to disable only the specific button being clicked
- Actions column in DataTable: Use render function with custom button element, pass row data to onClick handler
- apiPost return type: Can be ignored if response data not needed, just await the promise for success/error handling
- Frontend working directory: All frontend commits in /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-ops-dashboard/
- The /stocks route was already registered in router.tsx from OPS-024, so no router changes needed
- DataTable onSort callback: Pass empty arrow function (() => {}) when sorting not implemented yet

- Date inputs need to be converted from ISO format to YYYY-MM-DD format for HTML date inputs (use .split('T')[0])
- Checkbox inputs should have unique IDs when used in multiple modals (e.g., 'isMaterial' and 'isMaterialEdit')
- Filter options can include a placeholder "All Stocks" even for text-based filters like stockId
- Textarea fields don't need FormField wrapper - can be implemented inline with proper styling
- Badge variants: 'success' for positive states (Material), 'info' for neutral states (Non-material)
- ExternalPencil link rendering pattern: check for value existence, then render <a> with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

- Added ExportButton for CSV/JSON export functionality
- Created DataTable with 8 columns: stockTicker, ruleType, conditionOperator, frequency, threshold, isActive (rendered as Badge), lastTriggeredAt (formatted or 'Never'), createdAt
- Built Create/Edit modals with comprehensive form fields:
  - userId (text input)
  - stockTicker (text input)
  - ruleType (text input)
  - triggerConditions (JSON textarea with validation)
  - conditionOperator (select: AND/OR)
  - frequency (select: realtime/hourly/daily/weekly)
  - threshold (number input, optional)
  - isActive (checkbox)
- Added JSON validation for triggerConditions field with error display
- Implemented delete action with ConfirmDialog (danger variant)
- Route already registered at /alert-rules in router.tsx
- Build passes successfully
Files changed:
- src/pages/AlertRules.tsx (updated from placeholder to full implementation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- JSON validation in forms: Wrap JSON.parse in try-catch and set error state for invalid JSON
- Optional numeric fields: Use empty string in form state, convert to number or null when submitting
- Badge variants for status: 'success' for active/enabled states, 'info' for inactive/disabled
- Textarea styling: Use font-mono and text-sm classes for JSON editing
- Form validation: Validate before submit, show inline errors per field
- The route was already registered from OPS-024, so no router changes needed
