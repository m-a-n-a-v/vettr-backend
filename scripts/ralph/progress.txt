# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-08
Project: VETTR Backend
---

## Codebase Patterns

### ESM Import Rules
- ALL local imports must use `.js` extension: `import { app } from './app.js'`
- Package imports do NOT use extensions: `import { Hono } from 'hono'`

### Build Command
- `npm run build` — TypeScript compilation via tsc
- `npm run dev` — Development server via tsx watch
- `npm run test` — Run vitest

### Project Root
- `/Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend`

### Key Dependencies
- hono: Web framework
- drizzle-orm + @neondatabase/serverless: Database ORM + driver
- @upstash/redis + @upstash/ratelimit: Cache + rate limiting
- zod: Validation
- jsonwebtoken + bcrypt: Auth utilities
- @hono/zod-openapi + @hono/swagger-ui: API documentation

## US-001: Initialize project with TypeScript, Hono, and essential dependencies
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Ran npm install successfully (164 packages installed)
- Verified src/index.ts starts Hono server on PORT 3000 via @hono/node-server
- Verified src/app.ts exports configured Hono app with /v1 base path
- npm run build compiles successfully with zero errors
- Tested GET /v1/health endpoint returns proper JSON response
- Files changed: package-lock.json (added)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project scaffold was already in place with basic structure
  - Build system works correctly with ESM imports (.js extensions)
  - Health endpoint follows standardized response format with success/data pattern
  - All npm scripts are correctly configured (dev, build, test, typecheck)
  - Basic middleware (logger, cors) already registered on Hono app
---

## US-002: Configure environment variable validation with Zod
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/env.ts with Zod schema for environment validation
- Validated PORT, NODE_ENV, DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, UPSTASH vars
- Set appropriate defaults: PORT=3000, NODE_ENV=development, JWT_SECRET has dev default
- Made DATABASE_URL and Upstash Redis vars optional for local development
- Made OAuth credentials (Google, Apple) optional
- Added safeParse with error formatting and process.exit(1) on validation failure
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/env.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zod's transform() method useful for converting string env vars to numbers
  - Using .optional() allows graceful degradation in development mode
  - safeParse() provides better error messages than parse() for env validation
  - process.exit(1) after validation errors prevents app from starting with bad config
---

## US-003: Set up Drizzle ORM with Neon PostgreSQL connection
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/database.ts exporting Drizzle db instance
- Configured Neon serverless driver with Pool and DATABASE_URL from env
- Added graceful error handling with different behaviors for dev vs production
- Database features disabled when DATABASE_URL not set (useful for development)
- Production mode exits if database connection fails (fail-fast principle)
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/database.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Neon's Pool class from @neondatabase/serverless handles connection pooling automatically
  - Drizzle's drizzle() function accepts the pool and returns a typed database client
  - Graceful degradation pattern useful: warn in dev, exit in production
  - Console logging with emoji prefixes (✅, ⚠️, ❌, 💥) improves readability
  - Exported db is nullable in type system, services should handle null checks
---

## US-004: Set up Upstash Redis client
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/redis.ts with Upstash Redis client initialization
- Used @upstash/redis with REST URL and token from environment variables
- Created src/services/cache.service.ts with comprehensive cache helpers: get, set, del, delMany, exists, ttl
- All helpers include proper error handling and return gracefully when Redis unavailable
- Follows same graceful degradation pattern as database.ts (fail-fast in production, warn in dev)
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/redis.ts (created), src/services/cache.service.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - @upstash/redis uses REST API, so no persistent connections needed
  - Cache service returns null/false when Redis unavailable, allowing services to proceed without caching
  - setex() method combines set + expiry in single operation for TTL-based caching
  - Added bonus helpers (delMany, exists, ttl) for future use cases
  - TypeScript generics on get/set allow type-safe caching with proper inference
  - Pattern: all cache operations try/catch with error logging, never throw to caller
---

## US-005: Create standardized API response builder utilities
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/types/api.ts with comprehensive response types (ApiSuccessResponse, ApiErrorResponse, PaginatedResponse)
- Created src/types/pagination.ts with PaginationParams and PaginationMeta types
- Created src/utils/response.ts with success(), error(), and paginated() builder functions
- All responses include meta object with timestamp (ISO 8601) and request_id (UUID v4)
- Created src/types/index.ts barrel export for clean imports
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/types/api.ts, src/types/pagination.ts, src/types/index.ts, src/utils/response.ts (all created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Standardized response format: { success: boolean, data/error: ..., meta: { timestamp, request_id } }
  - Paginated responses nest items and pagination info under data field
  - Error responses have structured error object with code, message, and optional details
  - Using crypto.randomUUID() for Node.js 20+ request ID generation (no external dependency)
  - TypeScript generics on response builders allow type inference for data payloads
  - ResponseMeta interface ensures consistency across all response types
  - snake_case used for all JSON fields (timestamp, request_id, has_more, etc.) per API standards
---
## US-006: Create custom error classes and global error handler
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/utils/errors.ts with comprehensive error class hierarchy
  - AppError base class with statusCode, code, details, isOperational properties
  - Subclasses: AuthRequiredError, AuthExpiredError, AuthInvalidCredentialsError, ForbiddenError, NotFoundError, ValidationError, RateLimitError, TierLimitError, ConflictError, InternalError
  - All error codes defined as TypeScript union type
  - Proper prototype chain setup for instanceof checks
- Created src/middleware/error-handler.ts with global error handler
  - Handles AppError instances with proper status codes
  - Handles Zod validation errors with 422 status
  - Handles generic HTTP errors
  - Hides sensitive error details in production, shows stack traces in development
  - Logs all errors with timestamp for debugging
- Registered error handler on Hono app using app.onError()
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/utils/errors.ts (created), src/middleware/error-handler.ts (created), src/app.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hono's c.json() requires status codes to be cast as `any` to avoid TypeScript errors with ContentfulStatusCode type
  - AppError base class should include isOperational flag to distinguish between operational and programming errors
  - Error.captureStackTrace() maintains proper stack traces in V8 engines
  - Object.setPrototypeOf() required after super() call for proper instanceof behavior with custom error classes
  - Error handler middleware receives (err, c) signature in Hono
  - Environment-based error detail exposure prevents leaking sensitive info in production
  - All errors logged to console for debugging, should integrate with structured logging service later

## US-007: Create users and refresh_tokens database schema
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/db/schema/users.ts with users table
  - Columns: id (UUID PK), email (unique), display_name, avatar_url (nullable), tier (default 'free'), password_hash (nullable), auth_provider (default 'email'), auth_provider_id (nullable), created_at, updated_at
  - Supports multiple authentication providers: email/password, Google OAuth, Apple Sign In
- Created refresh_tokens table
  - Columns: id (UUID PK), user_id (FK to users with CASCADE delete), token_hash, expires_at, is_revoked (default false), created_at
  - Supports token rotation for enhanced security
- Created src/db/schema/index.ts barrel export for clean imports across the codebase
- All column names use snake_case convention (display_name, avatar_url, auth_provider, etc.)
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/db/schema/users.ts (created), src/db/schema/index.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Drizzle ORM uses camelCase in TypeScript but automatically maps to snake_case in SQL
  - Use .references() for foreign keys with onDelete: 'cascade' for automatic cleanup
  - Use .defaultRandom() for UUID primary keys (generates UUIDv4 at database level)
  - Nullable fields (password_hash, avatar_url, auth_provider_id) allow flexibility for different auth flows
  - password_hash nullable because OAuth users don't have passwords
  - auth_provider_id stores the provider's unique ID for the user (Google sub, Apple user ID, etc.)
  - Refresh tokens stored hashed for security, never stored in plaintext
  - Token rotation requires new token generation and old token revocation on each refresh

  - Drizzle's index() function takes table columns as parameters for creating indexes
  - Use doublePrecision() for floating-point numbers (market_cap, price, price_change)
  - Use integer() for whole numbers (vetr_score)
  - ticker field is unique and indexed for fast lookups
  - Indexes on sector and exchange enable efficient filtering and searching
  - updatedAt timestamp uses defaultNow() for automatic timestamp management
  - All schema files follow consistent pattern: pgTable definition with indexes callback

  - Join tables for many-to-many relationships use composite PKs instead of separate id column
  - text() type in Drizzle for long-form content without length restrictions (better than varchar for summaries)
  - Boolean fields with default values provide sensible defaults (is_material defaults to false)
  - Foreign key CASCADE deletes ensure referential integrity (deleting stock removes all its filings)
  - Indexes on foreign keys (stock_id) and frequently queried columns (date) improve query performance
  - Per-user read status pattern: join table with user_id + entity_id composite PK

  - previousCompanies uses JSONB to store array of company names for flexible career history tracking
  - Double precision for yearsAtCompany allows fractional years (e.g., 2.5 years)
  - Social media fields (LinkedIn, Twitter) are nullable since not all executives have public profiles
  - Education and specialization are varchar fields with appropriate length constraints
  - Foreign key CASCADE delete ensures executives are automatically removed when stock is deleted
  - Default empty array [] for previousCompanies provides sensible default for new records
  - Indexes on both foreign keys (stock_id) and searchable text fields (name) improve query performance

  - Tier limits (FREE=5, PRO=25, PREMIUM=unlimited) enforced at service layer, not database
  - Composite primaryKey() syntax: primaryKey({ columns: [table.col1, table.col2] })
  - Index on userId enables efficient filtering of watchlist items by user
  - CASCADE delete on both foreign keys ensures referential integrity (removing user or stock cleans up watchlist entries)
  - addedAt timestamp useful for "recently added" sorting and tracking when stocks were added to watchlist
  - Pattern follows same conventions as filing_reads join table (composite PK, FKs with CASCADE)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VETR Score breakdown into 5 component scores (pedigree, filing_velocity, red_flag, growth, governance) enables detailed analysis
  - Bonus and penalty points stored separately allow tracking of adjustments to base score
  - Historical tracking via calculated_at timestamp enables trend analysis over time
  - stock_ticker stored as varchar instead of FK to stocks table - provides flexibility if score calculated before stock fully onboarded
  - All score fields are integers (0-100 range) for consistency with VETR Score algorithm
  - Default values for bonusPoints and penaltyPoints (0) ensure clean data when no adjustments applied
  - Index on calculated_at crucial for time-series queries (e.g., "get score history for last 6 months")
  - Pattern follows same conventions as other schema files (pgTable with indexes callback)

  - Red flag severity levels: Low (<30), Moderate (30-60), High (60-85), Critical (>85) will be used in detection service
  - Red flag types will include: consolidation_velocity, financing_velocity, executive_churn, disclosure_gaps, debt_trend
  - Sync status values: pending, success, failed (simple state machine for sync operations)
  - User settings as JSONB allows flexible schema-free storage for app preferences, notification settings, etc.
