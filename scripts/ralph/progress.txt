# Ralph Progress Log

Project: VETTR Backend

## Codebase Patterns

### ESM Import Rules
- ALL local imports must use `.js` extension: `import { app } from './app.js'`
- Package imports do NOT use extensions: `import { Hono } from 'hono'`

### Build Command
- `npm run build` — TypeScript compilation via tsc
- `npm run dev` — Development server via tsx watch
- `npm run test` — Run vitest

### Project Root
- `/Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-backend`

### Key Dependencies
- hono: Web framework
- drizzle-orm + @neondatabase/serverless: Database ORM + driver
- @upstash/redis + @upstash/ratelimit: Cache + rate limiting
- zod: Validation
- jsonwebtoken + bcrypt: Auth utilities
- @hono/zod-openapi + @hono/swagger-ui: API documentation

## US-001: Initialize project with TypeScript, Hono, and essential dependencies
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Ran npm install successfully (164 packages installed)
- Verified src/index.ts starts Hono server on PORT 3000 via @hono/node-server
- Verified src/app.ts exports configured Hono app with /v1 base path
- npm run build compiles successfully with zero errors
- Tested GET /v1/health endpoint returns proper JSON response
- Files changed: package-lock.json (added)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project scaffold was already in place with basic structure
  - Build system works correctly with ESM imports (.js extensions)
  - Health endpoint follows standardized response format with success/data pattern
  - All npm scripts are correctly configured (dev, build, test, typecheck)
  - Basic middleware (logger, cors) already registered on Hono app

## US-002: Configure environment variable validation with Zod
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/env.ts with Zod schema for environment validation
- Validated PORT, NODE_ENV, DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, UPSTASH vars
- Set appropriate defaults: PORT=3000, NODE_ENV=development, JWT_SECRET has dev default
- Made DATABASE_URL and Upstash Redis vars optional for local development
- Made OAuth credentials (Google, Apple) optional
- Added safeParse with error formatting and process.exit(1) on validation failure
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/env.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zod's transform() method useful for converting string env vars to numbers
  - Using .optional() allows graceful degradation in development mode
  - safeParse() provides better error messages than parse() for env validation
  - process.exit(1) after validation errors prevents app from starting with bad config

## US-003: Set up Drizzle ORM with Neon PostgreSQL connection
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/database.ts exporting Drizzle db instance
- Configured Neon serverless driver with Pool and DATABASE_URL from env
- Added graceful error handling with different behaviors for dev vs production
- Database features disabled when DATABASE_URL not set (useful for development)
- Production mode exits if database connection fails (fail-fast principle)
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/database.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Neon's Pool class from @neondatabase/serverless handles connection pooling automatically
  - Drizzle's drizzle() function accepts the pool and returns a typed database client
  - Graceful degradation pattern useful: warn in dev, exit in production
  - Console logging with emoji prefixes (✅, ⚠️, ❌, 💥) improves readability
  - Exported db is nullable in type system, services should handle null checks

## US-004: Set up Upstash Redis client
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-08
Details:
- Created src/config/redis.ts with Upstash Redis client initialization
- Used @upstash/redis with REST URL and token from environment variables
- Created src/services/cache.service.ts with comprehensive cache helpers: get, set, del, delMany, exists, ttl
- All helpers include proper error handling and return gracefully when Redis unavailable
- Follows same graceful degradation pattern as database.ts (fail-fast in production, warn in dev)
- npm run build passes with zero errors
- Files changed: src/config/redis.ts (created), src/services/cache.service.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - @upstash/redis uses REST API, so no persistent connections needed
  - Cache service returns null/false when Redis unavailable, allowing services to proceed without caching
  - setex() method combines set + expiry in single operation for TTL-based caching
  - Added bonus helpers (delMany, exists, ttl) for future use cases
  - TypeScript generics on get/set allow type-safe caching with proper inference
  - Pattern: all cache operations try/catch with error logging, never throw to caller
